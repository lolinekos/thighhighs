> ### Overview
> ---
> This new CNC includes many __new__ features, but
> also a robust structure. The structure and
> code from this cnc was made especially for
> this case. Many of the features will be
> built into the language by *injecting:
> classes, methods, and functions into the
> global scope of the interpreter. The reason
> for this is to hopefully give the user some
> __freedom__ as compared to other options. Users whom
> may __not__ want or can't use these features due
> to a *lack of knowledge*, have also been kept in
> mind. 
> ### Quick Start
> Needed:
> - linux server `x86` or `amd64`\
*preferably with root access for quickstart command*
> ```bash
> chmod 777 run.sh; ./run.sh
>```
