# Member Management
> ## Members
> To manage members
> ## Roles
> Roles use a lot of the same commands members have, though they only effect the role(s) you select.
> ### Role Attributes
> > Here is a list of role attributes:
> > - timelimit
> > - concurrents
> > - cooldown
> > - permissions
> > 
> > *Expiry is only used in relation to a role given to a member*
> ### Inherited Role Attributes
> > If a role has a **higher** *timelimit*, *cooldown*, *concurrent* limit, or *permissions* which the member **does not** have, they will be inherited.
> > Expiry of a role given to a member **only** relates to that member and the role they have been given.
>
> Keep in mind that if your **remove** a role, or **change** it's *timelimit*, *cooldown*, *concurrent* limit, or *permissions* this will effect **all** members who have the role if they **are inheriting** those from the role.
